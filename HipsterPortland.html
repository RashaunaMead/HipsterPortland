	<p id="portland"> Welcome to Portland Hipster Guide!<br><br>  
	When visiting Portland for the first time, don't worry - this guide will help you find all the places that most people don't even know about.  You can easily spend your days in Portland without being bothered by pesky mainstream businesses or activities.  Want to catch a concert for a band that you can claim you knew about before anyone else?  Well, you are in the right place. Portland has plenty of venues where you can catch a show of a band before they become cool.  And don't fret, all of the coffee shops and restaurants aren't just independently-owned, they source local too.  Need to find a vintage LP for your newly purchased thrift store record player?  Fear not, Portland has a host of off the beaten path record stores for you! Here in Stumptown you can live it up hipster-style (but we'll keep that hipster part on the DL).
